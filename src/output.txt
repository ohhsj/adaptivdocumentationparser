It covers the following topics: \r\n Overview \r\n Features \r\nOverview \r\nartiQ is a risk-focussed, high-performance replacement for Microsoft SQL Server Analysis \r\nServices (SSAS). It is an OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP), data mining and reporting \r\ntechnology, similar to Microsoft SSAS.   \r\nartiQ supports the major OLAP methods of connection. This means that Microsoft Excel \r\ncan be used to query, slice-and-dice, generate reports and drilldown into the massive \r\namounts of data that can be hosted by artiQ. \r\nFor information on how to install artiQ, refer to the artiQ Installation Guide (R1). \r\nFeatures \r\nartiQ was created after many years of working with Microsoft SSAS at large financial \r\ninstitutions.   \r\nMicrosoft SSAS is a generic product that can serve the needs of many small to large \r\nbusinesses.  However,  a  more  performance-targeted technology can  help to  achieve \r\ncloser to real-time updates with a large number of users. \r\nThe following features of artiQ make it suit your needs for analytical processing, data \r\nmining and reporting: \r\n It responds to data-mining queries fast because all the data is served straight from \r\nRandom Access Memory (RAM), rather than a disc or a combination of RAM and \r\ndisc. \r\n It is  inherently  designed  to  remain responsive  to  multiple  users. For  more \r\ninformation, refer to the section Multiple Users. \r\n It scales well and can take advantage of big hardware with a large number of \r\ncores. \r\n It can handle the volumes and types of data that the financial industry generates \r\nby using vectorised values. \r\nFor a deeper insight into the architecture of artiQ, refer to the artiQ Architecture Guide \r\n(R2). \r\n  \r\n----------------Page (4) Break----------------\r\n \r\nAdaptiv artiQ Technology 6 Overview \r\nChapter 3 \r\nKey Concepts \r\nThis chapter explains the key concepts related to artiQ. It covers the following topics: \r\n Multiple Users \r\n Simultaneous Actions \r\n Data Sources \r\n Flexibility \r\nMultiple Users \r\nartiQ responds to queries from multiple users simultaneously. The core of artiQ makes use \r\nof multiple processors to carry out queries in parallel, on the data that is held in the \r\nmemory. \r\nNot only can artiQ answer queries from multiple users, it also supports What-If style \r\nanalysis,  where a user  can  see the results  of  potential  changes  in  a  sandboxed \r\nenvironment, without affecting the other users. \r\nSimultaneous Actions \r\nA typical artiQ environment will not just have multiple users querying static data. The data \r\nitself is likely to be updated intra-day with corrections and at the end of day (EOD) with \r\nadditional data. \r\nMicrosoft SSAS allows updates  and corrections  to  data, but  being disc-based, these \r\nupdates can cause hiccups and interruptions to other users. This is not the case with \r\nartiQ, which is super-smooth at changing data. During tests, the users were completely \r\nunaware that corrections and updates had even occurred. \r\nartiQ achieves this smoothness by loading changes into the memory and applying them at \r\nonce, in a transactional manner. This is rapid and does not interfere with the other users, \r\nallowing them to carry on uninterrupted. \r\nData Sources \r\nartiQ can host data from the typical sources.  \r\n It can use a staging database when acting in its role as a performance boost to a \r\nMicrosoft SSAS system.  \r\n It can use the disc-based files if it needs to be used in a stand-alone environment.   \r\n It can also be extended, using the software plug-ins so that it can use those data \r\nsources that are not yet supported.   \r\n----------------Page (5) Break----------------\r\n \r\nAdaptiv artiQ Technology 7 Overview \r\nExample: An example of such a software plugin would be loading files from an \r\nAmazon S3 cloud. \r\nFlexibility \r\nEach artiQ service can support multiple cubes, with each cube containing data unrelated \r\nto the other cube. Each cube can hold data spanning a number of days. Alternatively, \r\neach artiQ service could contain just one cube with just one day of data.  \r\nartiQ can also be used in conjunction with Microsoft SSAS, so that the recent data is \r\nhosted by artiQ for fast and frequent access, but the older, historical data is maintained by \r\nMicrosoft SSAS for infrequent reporting. \r\nTherefore, artiQ is flexible to the needs of the users and as per the available hardware. \r\nFor more information about hardware-related requirements for artiQ, refer to the artiQ \r\nHardware Sizing Guide (R3). \r\n----------------Page (6) Break----------------\r\n \r\nAdaptiv artiQ Technology 8 Overview \r\nChapter 4 \r\nSample artiQ Systems \r\nThis chapter provides few samples explaining various methods of implementing artiQ on \r\nyour system. \r\nSample System 1 \r\nThe following sample system illustrates a simple configuration where artiQ hosts the data \r\nfrom a file or files, with Microsoft Excel being used for data mining. \r\n \r\nFigure 1 Sample System 1 \r\nSample System 2 \r\nThe following sample system illustrates artiQ using an Adaptiv RiskCube (ARC) staging \r\ndatabase with either Microsoft Excel or ARC being used for data mining. This is a fairly \r\ntypical configuration. \r\n \r\nFigure 2 Sample System 2 \r\n----------------Page (7) Break----------------\r\n \r\nAdaptiv artiQ Technology 9 Overview \r\nFor details on how to integrate artiQ with ARC, refer to the artiQ RiskCube Integration \r\nGuide (R4). \r\nSample System 3 \r\nThe following sample system illustrates a much larger system than the ones shown in the \r\nprevious samples. In this sample, artiQ provides high-performance data mining for recent \r\ninformation, for example T-1 to T-10.  \r\nMicrosoft SSAS is used to make older information available, for example T-11 and older, \r\nbut offers a slower access for less frequent reporting. \r\n \r\nFigure 3 Sample System 3 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n----------------Page (8) Break----------------\r\n \r\nAdaptiv artiQ Technology 10 Overview \r\nCopyright, Confidentiality, and Disclaimer \r\nCOPYRIGHT  ©  2016  Fidelity  National  Information  Services, Inc.
